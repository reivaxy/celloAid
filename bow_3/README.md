This iteration is intended to allow easy measurement for finger sizes and finger spacing.

Horizontal spacing is adjustable with rings sliding horizontally, with blocking screws, and sizing is made easy by changing the rings.

Small inconvenient is the sliders make the rings a bit farther from each other vertically, and some weight is added
(big slider + screw and nut), but it's just a prototype and once spacing and sizes are measured, next one will no longer be adjustable.


The hair tension can be adjusted at will without removing the device.
