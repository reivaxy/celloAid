Unfortunately the silicon is too heavy, adding about 60g hence doubling the total weight of the device.

This new prototype is intended to be completed by thermo-plastic tightely adjusted around finger and thumb.

Therefore the finger and thumb slots were removed.

One challenge was to replace the low screw since it was on the removed thumb slot.
