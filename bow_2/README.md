Same issue than with bow_1 prototype, still needs to be removed to adjust the hair tension.

Compared to bow_1 prototype, the space between the two finger rings is better but not vertical enough to allow Soni use the full wrist flexion.

Also the finger rings are too large and don't provide a firm enough grip.

The two halves are held together by sliding clips
